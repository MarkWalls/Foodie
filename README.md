Foodie
======
A public list of recipies that can be filtered by the alergies and food requirements of users.

##What am I doing?
* This will be an open source project to create a framework for sharing links to food recipes. 
* The API will digest the recipe that the link points to and gets a list of the ingredients.
* Users will put foods that they are trying to avoid and foods they need in their diet in their user profiles.
* When the user searches for recipes the URL's will automatically be filtered to their needs.
* Users will be able to manually tag recipes as well for types of food.
